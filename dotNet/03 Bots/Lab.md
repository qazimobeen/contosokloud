# Create bots, connectors, and tabs in Microsoft Teams
Microsoft Teams is a chat-based conversation tool, that contains everything your team needs to keep in touch.  You can extend Teams by building Bots and Connectors, as well as extending the user interface with custom Tabs.  In this training module, weâ€™ll build a Bot that integrates with Teams.

## Prerequisites
1. You must have an Office 365 tenant and Windows Azure subscription to complete this lab. If you do not have one, the lab for **O3651-7 Setting up your Developer environment in Office 365** shows you how to obtain a trial.
2. You must have Visual Studio 2017 and the Bot Application template installed.
   - Download and install the Bot Application template zip from the direct download link [http://aka.ms/bf-bc-vstemplate](http://aka.ms/bf-bc-vstemplate)
   - Save the zip file to your Visual Studio 2017 templates directory which is traditionally located in `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ProjectTemplates\`

3. You must turn on Microsoft Teams for your organization and enable side-loading for your bots.
   - Follow the instructions in this link [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/setup](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/setup)
4. You must have Microsoft Teams installed.
   - Download it at this link [https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads).

## Lab Setup: Create a Bot for Teams

## Exercise 1: Building your Bot
In this exercise, you will create a Azure Web App to host your bot application and use VS to build your bot.

1. In a web browser, open the [Azure Management Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and log in with an administrator account
2. Click the **+** button
3. Click **Web + Mobile** | **Web App** 
4. Enter ***trainingcontentbotapi*** in the **App name** textbox
5. Select a **Subscription**
6. Create or select a **Resource Group**
7. Create or select an **App Service Plan**
8. Click the **Create** button
![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/1.png)  
9. After the Web Site is completed, click **App Services**
10. Click the Web Site you just created
11. Copy the web site **URL** and save it.  You will use it later.
![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/2.png)  
12. Launch **Visual Studio 2017** as an administrator
13. In Visual Studio 2017 select **File | New | Project**
14. Create a new Visual C# project using the **Bot Application** template  
![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/3.png)  

The template is a fully functional Echo Bot that takes the user's text utterance as input and returns it as output. In order to run the bot inside Microsoft Teams:

- The bot must be registered with the Bot Connector
- The AppId and AppPassword from the Bot Framework registration page have to be recorded in the project's web.config
- The Bot must be added to Microsoft Teams

The core functionality of the Bot Template is all in the Post method within the **Controllers\MessagesController.cs** class. The code that comes with the new Bot project takes user's text utterance as input, then creates a reply message using the **CreateReplyMessage** method.  The out of the box reply displays the user's text utterance and how many characters it contained.  

```csharp
public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Post([FromBody]Activity activity)
{
    if (activity.Type == ActivityTypes.Message)
    {
        ConnectorClient connector = new ConnectorClient(new Uri(activity.ServiceUrl));
        // calculate something for us to return
        int length = (activity.Text ?? string.Empty).Length;

        // return our reply to the user
        Activity reply = activity.CreateReply($"You sent {activity.Text} which was {length} characters");
        await connector.Conversations.ReplyToActivityAsync(reply);
    }
    else
    {
        HandleSystemMessage(activity);
    }
    var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
    return response;
}
```

In this lab you will modify the **Controllers\MessagesController.cs** class to answer the question "What is our inventory of replacement tires?" and return a random number.

The **BotAuthentication** decoration on the class is used to validate your Bot Connector credentials over HTTPS.

```csharp
[BotAuthentication]
public class MessagesController : ApiController
```

15. Open the **Controllers\MessagesController.cs** class.
16. Replace the Post method with the following code.

	```csharp	
    public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Post([FromBody]Activity activity)
    {
        if (activity.Type == ActivityTypes.Message)
        {
            ConnectorClient connector = new ConnectorClient(new Uri(activity.ServiceUrl));
            Activity reply;
            
			if (activity.Text.ToLower().Equals("what is our inventory of replacement tires?"))
            {
                Random random = new Random();
                reply = activity.CreateReply($"{random.Next(1,100)}");
            }
            else {
				// calculate something for us to return
            	int length = (activity.Text ?? string.Empty).Length;
            
                // return our reply to the user
                reply = activity.CreateReply($"You sent {activity.Text} which was {length} characters");
            }

            await connector.Conversations.ReplyToActivityAsync(reply);
        }
        else
        {
            HandleSystemMessage(activity);
        }
        var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
        return response;
    }
	```
17. Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**
18. Select **Microsoft Azure App Service** as the publish target
19. Select the **Select Existing** radio button
20. Click the **Publish** button
21. Select the Subscription where you created the Web Site
22. Select the **trainingcontentbotapi** App Service that you created
23. Click the **OK** button
![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/4.png)
24. Click the **Publish** button, wait and make sure the Bot is successfully published to the App Service.
